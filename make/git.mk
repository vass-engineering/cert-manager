# Lists all remote tags on the upstream, which gives tags in format:

# and manually removes v1.2.0-alpha.1, since that version's manifest contains
# duplicate CRD resources (2 CRDs with the same name) which in turn can cause problems
# with the versionchecker test.
# Open question: how do we decide when to refresh this target?

# The file "release-version" gets updated whenever git describe --tags changes.
# This is used by the bin/containers/*.tar.gz targets to make sure that the
# containers, which use the output of "git describe --tags" as their tag, get
# rebuilt whenever you check out a different commit. If we didn't do this, the
# Helm chart bin/cert-manager-*.tgz would refer to an image tag that doesn't
# exist in bin/containers/*.tar.gz.
#
# We use FORCE instead of .PHONY because this is a real file that can be used as
# a prerequisite. If we were to use .PHONY, then the file's timestamp would not
# be used to check whether targets should be rebuilt, and they would get
# constantly rebuilt.

## GOBUILDPROCS is passed to GOMAXPROCS when running go build; if you're running
## make in parallel using "-jN" then you'll probably want to reduce the value
## of GOBUILDPROCS or else you could end up running N parallel invocations of
## go build, each of which will spin up as many threads as are available on your
## system.
